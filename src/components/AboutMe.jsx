                I am a second degree student of mechatronics at the Bydgoszcz University of Technology.
                During my engineering studies, I learned the python programming language,
                thanks to this, I became more interested in programming and other languages such as javascript, which consumed me the most.

                My first projects (mainly websites) were based only on HTML and CSS. After two months, I made up my mind
                change something and introduce something new to my projects, this innovation for me at the moment was javascript.

                After a few months of learning programming in javascript, I decided to enrich my skills with the React library and various Frameworks.
                The projects were to a large extent to show my knowledge of the javascript language.
